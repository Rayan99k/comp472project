# COMP 472 CIFAR-10 Image Classification
## Contents

- load_dataset.py: Loads and preprocesses the CIFAR-10 dataset, resizing images and selecting a fixed number of samples per class for training and testing.
- feature_extraction.py: Extracts feature vectors from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a pre-trained ResNet-18 model and saves them for further processing.

- naive_bayes.py: Provides custom and Scikit-learn implementations of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm, including model saving and evaluation functionalitiesâ€‹.
- decision_tree.py: Implements both custom and Scikit-learn decision tree classifiers with support for saving, loading, and evaluating models at varying depths.
- mlp.py: Implements and trains Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models of varying depths and evaluates their performance.
- vgg11_experiment_kernel.py: Tests the effect of varying convolutional kernel sizes in a VGG11-based CNN on model performance and computational costs.
- vgg11_experiment_layers: Tests the effect of adding or removing layers in a VGG11-based CNN on model performance and computational costs.

- data/: Data generated by load_dataset.py is stored in this directory.
- models/: Models trained by various algorithms are stored in this directory.

## Data Pre-Processing
Steps to Pre-Process the Data:
1. Run load_dataset.py
  Verify that a new directory "/data" was created in the root directory.
  The terminal should output:
    Training Set: 5000 images
    Test Set: 1000 images
2. Run feature_extraction.py
  Verify that the following files are created in the root directory:
    - train_features.pt
    - test_features.pt
    - train_features.npy
    - train_labels.npy
    - test_features.npy
    - test_labels.npy

## Training and Evaluation
### Steps to Train the Models:
Required Pre-Processed Files:
List the files needed for training.
Command to Run Training:

Training Parameters:
Mention any adjustable parameters (e.g., epochs, learning rate).
Steps to Evaluate the Models:
Evaluation Files:
Mention files or checkpoints required for evaluation.
Command to Run Evaluation:
Provide the command for running evaluation scripts.
Metrics:
Briefly describe metrics calculated (e.g., accuracy, precision, F1-score).

## Model Application
Steps to Apply the Models:
Input Requirements:
Specify the type of input required for the model (e.g., an image or feature vector).
Command to Run Application:
Provide the command to apply the trained models.

## Notes
